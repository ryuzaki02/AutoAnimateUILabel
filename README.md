# AutoAnimateUILabel

UILabel animation from left to right and vice versa automatically and by the help of mouse drag.
Just download repo and run sample code to look futher into it. I used just UIView animation and NSTimer with mouse functionality to achieve this.
Simple code , go through it and implement anywhere you want to.
Thank you.
